Sale Order confirmation.

You can also directly create a DDT using
Inventory -> Operations -> DDT
menu and add existings delivery orders to it, in the 'transfers' tab.

You can add lines to an existing DDT using the 'Details' tab.
Lines can be descriptive or linked to a product. If linked to a product,
the stock movement will also be created.

When you work with delivery orders, you can create a DDT selecting 1 or more
pickings and launching the action 'DDT from pickings'.

Also, you can select 1 or more pickings and run 'add pickings to DDT' to add
the selected delivery orders to an existing DDT

If the state of the delivery orders allows it, you can deliver them from the
DDT directly, clicking 'put in pack' and 'package done'.

Otherwise, you can process delivery orders separately, then go to the DDT and
click on 'set done'.

Finally you can create your invoice directly from the DDT using the 
'Create Invoice' button that creates a new Invoice with the ddt lines as 
invoice lines
