3. Valid value (not null and not space) in specific document style (model multireport.style)
4. Value in default document style (model multireport.style)
5. For some parameters, for historical reason, value may be load from other sources (i.e. custom footer)

In report the fallback function is report.get_report_attrib(PARAM,o,doc_opts), where param is parameter to get value.
